## Example Conversation

```
You: Hello!

Bot: Hi there! I'm here to help you with spam detection. 
     Ask me anything about identifying spam messages!

You: I got a message saying I won $1000

Bot: ⚠️ SPAM ALERT: Messages offering free prizes, money, 
     or claiming you've won something are usually scams. 
     If you didn't enter a contest, you didn't win. 
     These messages try to steal your personal information or money.

You: What should I do?

Bot: If you receive a spam message:
     1. DON'T click any links
     2. DON'T reply
     3. DON'T share personal info
     4. DELETE the message
     5. BLOCK the sender
     6. REPORT to your carrier (forward to 7726/SPAM)
     7. Use our SMS Guard tool to analyze suspicious messages!

You: Thanks!

Bot: You're welcome! Stay safe out there! 🛡️
```

cd backend
python app.py
```
Check for errors in the console.
