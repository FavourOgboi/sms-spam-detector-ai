# 🎯 New User Setup Guide

## ✅ Demo User Removed - Fresh Start!

The demo user has been removed. Your SMS Guard app now requires **real user registration**.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. **Clean Database** (Optional)
If you want to start completely fresh:
```bash
python remove_demo_user.py
```

### 2. **Start Backend**
```bash
cd backend
python run.py
```

You should see:
```
============================================================
SMS Guard Flask Backend Starting...
Environment: development
Debug Mode: True
Host: 0.0.0.0
Port: 5000
Register new users at: http://localhost:5173/register
API will be available at: http://localhost:5000/api
Frontend should connect from: http://localhost:5173
============================================================
Database initialized
Ready for new user registrations
```

### 3. **Start Frontend**
```bash
npm run dev:frontend-only
```

### 4. **Register Your First User**
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click "Register" or go to `/register`
3. Create your account:
   - Choose a username
   - Enter your email
   - Set a password (min 6 characters)
4. Click "Create Account"
5. You'll be redirected to login
6. Sign in with your new credentials

## 🧪 Test New User Flow

Run the test to make sure everything works:
```bash
python test_new_user_flow.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Create a random test user
- ✅ Test registration
- ✅ Test login
- ✅ Test authenticated requests

## 🔧 What Changed

### Backend Changes:
- ❌ Removed demo user creation in `app.py`
- ✅ Updated startup messages in `run.py`
- ✅ Database still creates tables automatically

### Frontend Changes:
- ✅ No changes needed - registration already works
- ✅ Login form works with any valid user
- ✅ All features work for registered users

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **Real Users Only** - No more demo clutter
2. **Secure** - Each user has their own account
3. **Clean Database** - Fresh start for production
4. **Professional** - No demo credentials to remember

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **No Demo User** - You must register to use the app
- **Registration Required** - First-time users need to create accounts
- **All Features Work** - Profile management, password changes, etc.
- **Data Isolation** - Each user sees only their own data

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Registration Not Working?
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Test registration manually
python test_new_user_flow.py
```

### Login Issues?
- Make sure you registered first
- Check username/email spelling
- Verify password is correct
- Check browser console for errors

### Database Issues?
```bash
# Reset database completely
rm backend/smsguard.db
cd backend && python run.py
```
