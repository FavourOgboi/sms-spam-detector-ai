# Deployment Readiness Checklist (Backend on Render, No Docker)

- [ ] Analyze current backend deployment setup and requirements for Render
- [ ] Identify and remove unnecessary Docker-related files/configs (only those not needed for Render)
- [ ] Ensure backend dependencies and config files (requirements.txt, runtime.txt, etc.) are correct for Render
- [ ] Review and update render.yaml if needed for non-Docker deployment
- [ ] Verify backend can be deployed on Render without Docker (no Dockerfile dependency)
- [ ] Ensure no changes affect app functionality
- [ ] Test backend locally to confirm it still works after changes
- [ ] Document any changes made for deployment
