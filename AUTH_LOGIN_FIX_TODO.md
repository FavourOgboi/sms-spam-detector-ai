## Critical Fix: Frontend Still Using Production Backend

**Problem:**  
Your frontend is sending login requests to `https://sms-guard-backend.onrender.com/api` (production), not your local backend. This causes CORS errors and failed logins.

**Solution:**  
1. In your frontend project root, create or edit a file named `.env` (not `.env.example`).
2. Add or update this line (use the port your backend is running on):

   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
   ```

   (Or use `http://localhost:5000/api` if your backend is running on port 5000.)

3. **Save the `.env` file.**
4. **Stop** your frontend dev server if it's running (Ctrl+C in the terminal).
5. **Restart** the frontend dev server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and try logging in again.

If you still see requests going to the production backend, double-check:
- The `.env` file is in the frontend root (same folder as `package.json`).
- There are no typos in the variable name.
- You restarted the frontend dev server after editing `.env`.

If login still fails after this, provide the new error message for further diagnosis.
